# GeneticCars
A simple visualization of a genetic Algorithm in Processing IDE.


After importing to Processing, run the program.
You will now have the option to add obstacles to the course in the form of lines. Click once to start a line and again to end it. You may do this as many times as you like. If and agent (Car) "hits" a line or goes out of the boundaries of the screen it will be stopped.
You may now press ENTER to start the simulation. The agents will evolve to get as close as possible to the Target, starting from Start as specified in the Constants class.
